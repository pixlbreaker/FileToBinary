# FileToBinary
This takes any file and creates seperate bytes and adds it to a Binary File. So far it takes a file and bloats it up to 5-10 times
the amount of the original file.

Ex: 1kb txt file -> 5kb binary file

    15kb .docx file -> 105kb binary file
    
    
There is also alot of issues reading back to binary, not sure what this is. It looks like it takes raw bytes not the content itself.
